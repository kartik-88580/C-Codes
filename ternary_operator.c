Ternary Operators:ternary operator for decision making in place of longer 
if and else conditional statements.
The ternary operator take three arguments:

The first is a comparison argument
The second is the result upon a true comparison
The third is the result upon a false comparison

It helps to think of the ternary operator as a shorthand way or writing an if-else statement. 
Hereâ€™s a simple decision-making example using if and else:

format of ternary oparator:
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
